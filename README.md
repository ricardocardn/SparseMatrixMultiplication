# Java implementation for **Sparse Matrix Multiplication**

This repository offers a library for you to work with sparse matrices, so that you will be able to multiply matrices of large orders. You can check the efficiency of this implementation taking a look at the article ![Benchmarks of Sparse Matrix Multiplication](blob/master/Benchmark_of_Sparse_Matrix_Multiplication.pdf)
