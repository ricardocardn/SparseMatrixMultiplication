# Java implementation for **Sparse Matrix Multiplication**

This repository offers a library for you to work with sparse matrices so that you can multiply matrices of large orders. You can check the efficiency of this implementation by taking a look at the article [Benchmarks of Sparse Matrix Multiplication](blob/master/Benchmark_of_Sparse_Matrix_Multiplication.pdf)
